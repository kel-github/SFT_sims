# simulating SFT predictions, 

given a double factorial experiment, and assumptions regarding
parallel or serial nature of underlying architecture <p>

written by K. Garner getkellygarner@gmail.com   
based on code from Ami Eidels

using the assumptions set out in the book:  
Little, D. et al (2017). Systems Factorial Technology: A Theory  
                              Driven Methodology for the Identification of  
                              Perceptual and Cognitive Mechanisms  
particularly chapter 1:  
Alteri et al (2017). Historical Foundations and a Tutorial Introduction  
                        to SFT  
and
